# What is ISP?

* Interface Segment Principle(ISP) states, interfaces should be such that client shouldn't implement un-necessary functions which they are not gonna use anyways.
* In short, the idea is to divide the interfaces into smallest possible interfaces so that classes implementing it doesn't need to implement un-necessary function.
