# Factory Pattern
* The **Factory Pattern** is used when you have a superclass with multiple subclasses, and based on some input, you want to return one of the subclasses. 
* It defines a method that we can call to get an object of the desired class without having to use new.


# Abstract Factory Pattern
* The Abstract Factory Pattern is a super-factory that creates other factories. 
* It is useful when you have a family of related classes that should be created together.
* Think of it as a factory that creates other factories.
